# GopherTortoiseDensity
R Code for hierarchical modelling of Gopher Tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) density based on LTDS surveys and burrow scoping. The three example datasets provided are from 2015-2016 surveys of the inland habitat at the John F. Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA. Burrow occupancy data was taken from a larger dataset, and retained in order to demonstrate processing covariates in the data.
